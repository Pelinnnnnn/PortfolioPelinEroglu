            <img src="../img/bttc/signa_is_bankrupt.png" alt="" width="70%">
            <p>There is currently strong pressure on the neighbouring districts to the east, both on
                cultural initiatives and on the housing market, due to the development starting in the
                Hafencity area. There are times of upheaval ahead, the effects of which are already being
                felt.</p>
            <img src="../img/bttc/rents-are-rising.png" alt="Rents are Rising" width="70%">
            <p>Rents per square metre in Hamburg are very high on average, especially in the area of
                particularly small and large flats. Neighbourhoods such as Rothenburgsort and Veddel
                still offer affordable living space. However, with the forthcoming changes due to urban
                redevelopment and urban renewal projects, the signs are pointing to rising rents.</p>

            <h2 class="underchapter">Initiatives in Hamburg</h2>
            <p>After HafenCity, the Rotheburgsort, Hammerbrook and
                Veddel areas are now on the „urban upgrading“ programme.
                Various master plans and construction plans are threatening
                the existence of places of culture and togetherness and
                thus the livelihoods of many artists and cultural workers,
                founders and committed people.
                The wave of displacement and destruction of these
                important places only stops at the very few. As a result,
                the majority of the initiatives involved in the „AG Ost“
                association are currently under acute threat of eviction or
                have already been evicted.
                <b>At least 520 people are involved
                    in these initiatives and shared locations.</b>
