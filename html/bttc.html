        <p>Signa is bankrupt - What kind of Elbtower does Hamburg need?</p>
        <img src="/img/bttc/signa_is_bankrupt.png" alt="" width="70%">
        <p>There is currently strong pressure on the neighbouring districts to the east, both on
            cultural initiatives and on the housing market, due to the development starting in the
            Hafencity area. There are times of upheaval ahead, the effects of which are already being
            felt.</p>
        <img src="/img/bttc/rents-are-rising.png" alt="Rents are Rising" width="70%">
        <p>Rents per square metre in Hamburg are very high on average, especially in the area of
            particularly small and large flats. Neighbourhoods such as Rothenburgsort and Veddel
            still offer affordable living space. However, with the forthcoming changes due to urban
            redevelopment and urban renewal projects, the signs are pointing to rising rents.</p>
